## FAQ
Creating a guild in Discord has traditionally been available only to a limited number of users, which sometimes left many people without the opportunity to organize their own community. Our program changes this situation, opening access to the guild creation function for all users, regardless of their region. Now everyone will be able to create a unique space for communication, sharing experiences and leisure time together. Your ideas and community can become a reality with our software!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Determine the purpose of your guild. Think about what your community will be doing. It could be games, book discussions, art, or anything else. A clear purpose will help attract members interested in your topic.
> 2. Create a server. Go to Discord and select the option to create a new server. Name it according to your guild's theme and add a description so users know what to expect.
> 3. Customize the channels. Divide the server into text and voice channels by topic. For example, create channels for discussing games, sharing news, and just chatting. This will help maintain order and make communication more structured.
> 4. Assign roles. Create roles for members so that they can access certain channels and server features. This can include roles for moderators, active participants, and newcomers. Roles help organize server management and distinguish participants by their activity or achievements.
> 5. Establish rules. Define rules of behavior on the server to create a friendly and safe atmosphere. Clear rules will help avoid conflicts and maintain a positive climate.
> 6. Invite members. Spread the word about your guild on social networks, forums, or among friends. Create a unique invitation link to make it easy to join.
> 7. Organize events. Hold games, quizzes, or discussions to energize members. This will help create a close-knit community and keep the server interesting.
> 8. Listen to your participants. Regularly gather feedback and suggestions from your members to improve your server. This will help create an atmosphere where everyone feels important and heard.
